# Vulkan Notes

This is a collection of notes I'm taking while learning Vulkan. 

You may find there are suprisingly few code examples in this repository. This is because I'm trying a different approach to learn this API. Because the verboseness of Vulkan can easily overwhelm a novice beginner, I'm thinking maybe, just maybe by providing a more holistic view of the API, I can grasp the concepts better and not losing myself in the messy details of vk functions.

Reminder: These notes themselves are not sufficient for you to learn Vulkan, but they may help you understand the concepts better instead of blindly typing the code other people wrote, with little understanding the meaning of them.
